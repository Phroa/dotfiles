# dotfiles

Basic dotfiles to set up new machines with.

## Installation:

1. `cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/phroa/dotfiles`
2. `./install.sh` - note, this does not overwrite existing files. It will skip them.
3. Install a Powerline patched font from https://github.com/powerline/fonts to make sure Vim displays properly.
3. ????
4. Profit, I guess.
